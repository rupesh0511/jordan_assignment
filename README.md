For #heading1:
text-align: center; I've set the text alignment within the element with the ID heading1 to center. This centers the text horizontally within the element.

padding: 0.7% 0; I've added padding of 0.7% on the top and bottom of the element with the ID heading1. This creates spacing above and below the text content.

background: linear-gradient(to right, rgb(3,1,1), rgb(227,75,59)); I've applied a linear gradient background to the element with the ID heading1. The gradient transitions from a dark color (rgb(3,1,1)) on the left to a reddish color (rgb(227,75,59)) on the right.

color: white; I've set the text color within the element with the ID heading1 to white. This ensures that the text appears in a white color, providing a high contrast against the gradient background.

For the navigation bar with the class .nav, the background color is set to a solid black (RGBA 0, 0, 0) with full opacity (alpha 1), creating a dark background. The padding of 15 pixels around the content ensures some spacing between the content and the edges. The navigation bar is positioned as "sticky," which means it sticks to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls. The top: 0 property ensures it stays at the top. The text color within the navigation bar is set to white for high contrast.

The navigation bar contains flex items, as indicated by the display: flex property. The justify-content: center property centers the items along the main axis, providing a symmetrical appearance. The align-items: baseline property aligns the items at their text baseline, which is especially useful when text is involved. Additionally, the flex-wrap: wrap property allows the items to wrap to new lines if the space is limited.

There are two classes affecting header elements: .header and .headerl. Both classes add a margin of 35 pixels to the right side of the header elements. However, the .headerl class further adjusts the right margin to be 1.5% of the element's width, providing a slightly different spacing for this particular class.

The input elements are styled with a width of 30% of their containing element, making them responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes. The height is set to 21 pixels, and a margin of 5 pixels is added to the right side of each input element, creating a bit of spacing between adjacent inputs. The font size for the input elements is set to 21 pixels.

Lastly, when an input element is focused, the input:focus rule removes the default outline that browsers typically provide. This is achieved with the outline: none property, creating a cleaner and more polished appearance when users interact with input fields.

The #heading2 and #p1 IDs are used to style text within .text. The #heading2 has white color and a font size of 28.8 pixels, creating a prominent heading. Similarly, #p1 has white color and a font size of 19.2 pixels, providing descriptive text.

The #heading3 ID is used to style text within .section2a. It has an opacity of 0.7, creating a slightly faded appearance.
